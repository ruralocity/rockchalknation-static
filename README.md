# Rock Chalk Nation (static)

Rock Chalk Nation was a one-stop shop for all your Kansas Jayhawks news.
The service collected headlines from many news sources into one
convenient feed. Links went directly to the original sources. I created
this service to help me keep track of all the newspapers, blogs, and
other sources covering the Jayhawks.

I decided to shut down the site; this is a static version explaining
why.
