Rock Chalk Nation was a one-stop shop for all your Kansas Jayhawks news.
The service collected headlines from many news sources into one
convenient feed. Links went directly to the original sources. I created
this service to help me keep track of all the newspapers, blogs, and
other sources covering the Jayhawks. The service collected links to more
than 50,000 articles in a little more than five years.

I've decided to shut down Rock Chalk Nation, for reasons:

- I'm pretty sure I'm the only person who ever used it.
- Most of the sources I pulled headlines from either no longer publish
  to RSS, have gone behind paywalls, or just don't publish anymore.
- I'm tired of paying for and maintaining the server it's hosted on, and
  too lazy to move it to a managed platform.
- Honestly, with all the controversy around Kansas Athletics this year,
  and with the NCAA in general, I've lost a lot of interest.

I may do something else with the domain someday. In the meantime, if
you're looking for news about the Kansas Jayhawks, your best bets as
I write this are

- [KUsports.com](http://kusports.com): Free content from
  the Lawrence Journal-World
- [The Kansas City Star](https://www.kansascity.com/sports/college/big-12/university-of-kansas/): Paywalled
- [The University Daily Kansan](http://www.kansan.com/sports/): KU's
  student newspaper; free

Thank you for visiting, and Rock Chalk Jayhawk.
